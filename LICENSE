WINPFILTER COPYRIGHT / END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

winpfilter (https://winpfilter.org) is a lightweight packet filtering firewall 
framework for windows platform and is copyright (c) 2022-2023 by icSecLab 
All rights reserved.

Even though winpfilter source code is publicly available for review, it is
not open source software and may not be redistributed or used in other
software without special permission from the winpfilter Project. The
standard (free) version is usually limited to installation on five
systems. We fund the winpfilter project by selling commercial
license to a special winpfilter OEM edition. For more information 
please contect mailto:oem@winpfilter.org .

Free and open source software producers are also welcome to contact us
for redistribution requests. However, we normally recommend that such
authors instead ask your users to download and install winpfilter
themselves. It will be free for them if they need 5 or fewer copies.

If the winpfilter Project (directly or through one of our commercial
licensing customers) has granted you additional rights to winpfilter or
winpfilter OEM, those additional rights take precedence where they conflict
with the terms of this license agreement.

Since the winpfilter source code is available for download and review,
users sometimes contribute code patches to fix bugs or add new
features. By sending these changes to the winpfilter Project (including
through direct email or our mailing lists or submitting pull requests
through our source code repository), it is understood unless you
specify otherwise that you are offering the winpfilter Project the
unlimited, non-exclusive right to reuse, modify, and relicense your
code contribution so that we may (but are not obligated to)
incorporate it into winpfilter.  If you wish to specify special license
conditions or restrictions on your contributions, just say so when you
send them.
